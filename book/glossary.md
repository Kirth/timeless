##### Fileset

A Fileset is a term referring to set of files and directories, including some
standard posix metadata.  Roughly, you can consider it interchangeable with
simply saying "directory".  We give it a name in the Timeless Stack glossary
just to speak about it unambiguously.
A Fileset can be "packed" into a '[Ware](#Ware)'.

---

##### Ware

The "packed" form of a [Fileset](#Fileset).
Tarballs, git commits; many formats are defined.
Wares are immutable and identified a by '[WareID](#WareID)'.
We say that we "pack" a Fileset into a Ware, which results in a WareID;
and we an "unpack" a Ware to produce a Fileset after fetching it by WareID.

---

##### WareID

The __hash__ identifying a Ware.
Holding a WareID gives you an immutable reference to a [Ware](#Ware)
(which you can unpack into a [Fileset](#Fileset)).
