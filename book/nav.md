How to Navigate this document
=============================

If you're evaluating the Timeless Stack to understand why the project exists
and what's unique about the ecosystem, you'll want to start with the
[Design](./design/README.md) chapters.

If you're a person of action: the [Quickstart](./quickstart.md) section has
examples of using the tools.  The quickstart examples start with the lowest
level tools, then work gradually up the stack to the more expressive layers --
so keep this in mind if you have limited patience or time to experiment; the
commands you'll use the most in practice are actually at the end of the
quickstart series.

If you just need to brush up on some reference material: head to the
[CLI docs](./cli/README.md).  (But keep in mind most of the tools will also
generate their own help text in response to the `-h` or `--help` commands!)

The [Glossary](./glossary.md) is also a good quick reference for core concepts.

For a new reader, we recommend giving the [Design](./design/README.md) chapters
a quick skim for highlights, but jump to the [Quickstart](./quickstart.md)
examples as soon as things get too abstract.  Go back and forth in whatever
order interests you!
