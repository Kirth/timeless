Formulas
========

Formulas are one of the core API objects in the Timeless Stack.
They're a [Layer 1](../design/API#layer-1) object in the big picture.

Formulas are a description of a container, as a pure function:
we list inputs (by hash, thus immutably), then describe a process,
and list what paths in the filesystem we want to save as outputs.
