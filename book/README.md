Welcome

Welcome to the Timeless Stack documentation.

The Timeless Stack is three things:

1. a way of thinking -- things that work should continue to work;
  and computers should behave the same on tuesday, thursday, and every day.
2. a suite of software tools -- `repeatr`, `rio`, and `hitch` -- which
  ship data and run processes in containers, building other software reliably
  and reproducibly.
3. an ecosystem of software that can be derived from these basic tools, and
  runs, redistributes, and at your option, even rebuilds from source reliably.

In particular, it's important to emphasize that the Timeless Stack takes its
name **very** seriously.  We want Deep-time reproducibility: working with Repeatr
and the other tools in the Timeless Stack represents a commitment to reproducible
results today, tomorrow, next week, next year, and... you get the picture.
*Timeless*.

This documentation mostly assumes you're sold on Item #1.
We'll be talking mostly about the practical usage of the tools and their APIs in Item #2,
and giving demonstrations of how to produce Item #3 for yourself.

You should see a table of contents on the left, and page-flip buttons just below.
(On mobile you may need to click the pancake stack to show/hide the nav menu.)
